# Songs Search Engine

This project implements a **Songs Search Engine**, which allows users to search for songs from a dataset based on various criteria like song title, artist, and more. The project was developed using Python and integrated into a Google Colab notebook. It provides an interface to quickly and efficiently find songs matching user queries from the dataset provided.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search songs by title, artist, or any other relevant criteria.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Optimized for quick access to songs in the dataset.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The HTML file provides a simple and clean interface for users to interact with.


## Usage

1. Launch the search engine interface by running the code in the Colab notebook or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Enter a search query in the HTML interface.
3. View the results based on the songs matching the query.

## Files in this Repository
